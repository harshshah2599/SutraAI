# 🚀 SutraAI: Building a Smart Query Tool for Querying Multiple Documents 📚

# 👋 Introduction
In today's world, there is a lot of textual data present in various formats, and accessing the required information from this data can be a challenging task. The proposed project aims to build a 🔍 smart query tool that can query multiple documents and retrieve the relevant information based on user input queries.

## 🎯 Objectives:
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- 🏗️ Develop a backend that connects to Google Drive and allows users to upload their files and transcripts.
- 🤖 Build vector embeddings and indexing on the textual data for efficient querying.
- 🔎 Retrieve the relevant context from the data based on user input queries.
- 🧠 Use GPT-3 for summarization, phrasing, and question-answering to provide the user with a concise and accurate response.

## 📝 Methodology
The following steps will be followed to achieve the project objectives:
- Build a backend that connects to Google Drive and allows users to upload their files and transcripts. The backend will also provide an API for data retrieval.
- Develop vector embeddings and indexing on the textual data to improve the efficiency of querying.
- Use the vector embeddings and indexing to retrieve the relevant context from the data based on user input queries.
- Use GPT-3 to summarize the retrieved context and provide a concise and accurate response to the user's query. GPT-3 will also be used for phrasing and question-answering to provide a more natural language response.
- Build a user interface that allows the user to input queries and displays the relevant response.

## 📦 Deliverables
The following deliverables will be provided at the end of the project:
- A functional backend that connects to Google Drive and allows users to upload their files and transcripts.
- A vector embeddings and indexing system that improves the efficiency of querying.
- A query tool that retrieves the relevant context from the data based on user input queries.
- A GPT-3 integration that provides a concise and accurate response to the user's query.
- A user interface that allows the user to input queries and displays the relevant response.

## 🗓️ Timeline
- The proposed project will be completed in four months, with the following timeline:
- Backend development and Google Drive integration 📁
- Vector embeddings and indexing development 🔍 
- Query tool development 🛠️
- GPT-3 integration and user interface development 🤖

## 👉 Conclusion
The proposed project aims to build a smart query tool that can query multiple documents and retrieve the relevant information based on user input queries. The project will use Google Drive, vector embeddings, indexing, and GPT-3 to achieve this objective. The project will be completed in 2 weeks. The deliverables of the project will be a functional query tool with a user interface. 💻
