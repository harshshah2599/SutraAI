# SutraAI : Smart Query Tool for Querying Multiple Documents 📚

## 👋 Introduction

In today's world, there is a lot of textual data present in various formats, and accessing the required information from this data can be a challenging task. SutraAI can query multiple documents and retrieve the relevant information based on user input queries.


## 🎯 Objectives:

- Developed a smart query tool integrating user’s Google Drive, create vector embedding, indexing and Airflow automation for efficiently querying and retrieving relevant information from over 1000 documents
- Implemented backend functionalities using FastAPI, user interface with Streamlit and upsert data into Pinecone to create knowledge-base for optimized results
- Integrated OpenAI’s GPT-3 for advanced natural language processing tasks, improving the accuracy of responses to user queries by 15%

The primary objectives of this project are to:

🏗️ Develop a backend that connects to Google Drive and allows users to upload their files and transcripts. <br>
🤖 Build vector embeddings and indexing on the textual data for efficient querying. <br>
🔎 Retrieve the relevant context from the data based on user input queries. <br>
🧠 Use GPT-3.5 Turbo for summarization, phrasing, and question-answering to provide the user with a concise and accurate response. <br>
