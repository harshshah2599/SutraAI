# SutraAI


• Developed a smart query tool integrating user’s Google Drive, create vector embedding, indexing and Airflow automation for efficiently querying and retrieving relevant information from over 1000 documents
• Implemented backend functionalities using FastAPI, user interface with Streamlit and upsert data into Pinecone to create knowledge-base for optimized results
• Integrated OpenAI’s GPT-3 for advanced natural language processing tasks, improving the accuracy of responses to user queries by 15%

The primary objectives of this project are to:

🏗️ Develop a backend that connects to Google Drive and allows users to upload their files and transcripts.
🤖 Build vector embeddings and indexing on the textual data for efficient querying.
🔎 Retrieve the relevant context from the data based on user input queries.
🧠 Use GPT-3.5 Turbo for summarization, phrasing, and question-answering to provide the user with a concise and accurate response.
